# Alfido_Tech_Task-1_Zomato_Data_Analysis_by_Rahul_Wagh

### **Description**  
This project analyzes the Zomato restaurant dataset using various data analytics techniques. It aims to clean the data, explore key variables, and generate insights on restaurant trends and customer preferences. The process includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to reveal patterns in ratings, votes, popular cuisines, and service options like online ordering and table booking.

### **Key Features**
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled missing and invalid data, converted categorical and numeric columns, removed duplicates, and filtered infrequent categories.
- **Outlier Detection and Handling**: Identified and removed outliers using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method for key variables such as ratings, votes, and cost for two.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generated insights on customer ratings, voting patterns, and the impact of online ordering and table booking on restaurant performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Used various visual tools such as heatmaps, boxplots, histograms, and word clouds to present the findings and patterns in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzed relationships between numeric variables (ratings, votes, and cost) using a correlation matrix.

### **Skills Used:-** 
*Data Analysis, Python, Machine Learning, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Outlier Detection, IQR Method, Correlation Analysis, Statistical Analysis*

### **Conclusion**
This project analyzed the Zomato dataset to reveal customer behaviour and restaurant performance insights. Key findings emphasize the role of online services like ordering and table booking in shaping customer ratings. Outlier detection enhanced data reliability, while visualizations clarified the links between restaurant attributes and customer feedback. Overall, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization provided actionable insights for food and beverage industry stakeholders.
